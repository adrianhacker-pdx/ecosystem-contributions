# Action Hub Architecture

## How to Use

All the contributor documentation and actionable items are kept in a single repository that exists at this URL:  [https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem-contributions](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem-contributions)  This is a one-stop shop for everything that is happening to build out and/or improve the Optimism Ecosystem.  This should be the first place you go to find answers to any questions you may have. &#x20;

In this repository, you can do things such as find an open project that matches your skills.  Ask questions by posting them as comments in the original GitHub issue.  Look at the Ecosystem Contributor project board.  Propose an ecosystem improvement that can be anything from a minor correction to a completely theoretical and novel use case within the Optimism Ecosystem.

You can find support and access important links within Optimism.  Finally, you can find a curated list of training resources with topics for all skill levels that can introduce you to some tools and concepts you may be unfamiliar with.

### Task Categories

Contribution opportunities are loosely organized into "categories" which give a sense of the relative scope, utility, and complexity of any given project. Refer to the sections below to understand what each of these categories means and what type of tasks or ideas you can expect to find within a category.

#### ‚ú® Contribution Opportunities

Contribution Opportunities are concrete and tightly scoped ways for you to contribute to the Optimism Collective ecosystem (e.g., ‚Äúreview the Bedrock smart contracts‚Äù or ‚Äúfix this specific bug‚Äù). Contribution Opportunities are smaller tasks and require less context so that you can get to work right away. Available opportunities might touch many different codebases within the broader Optimism ecosystem.

#### üß™ Mad Science Project Ideas

Mad Science Project Ideas are ideas for projects that could work well as a fun hack or a hackathon project. Mad Science Project Ideas may not have clear immediate value for the Optimism ecosystem (yet) but act as useful explorations of novel concepts. These ideas are great for anyone looking to mess around with new tools and push the boundaries of what's possible with crypto.

#### üìù Draft Project Ideas

Draft Project Ideas are ideas for projects that have value for the Optimism ecosystem but may not yet be fully understood in a manner that can be deeply specified. Here you'll find stuff that makes you think, "This would be useful, but I'm not exactly sure how it would work in practice". Are you going to be the one to figure out how it should work?

#### üî¥ Ecosystem Project Ideas

Ecosystem Project Ideas are ideas for projects that have clear value for the Optimism ecosystem and are understood well enough that they can be (mostly) fully specified.  Ecosystem Project Ideas contain a concrete project task, a basic specification for what the project could look like, and a list of features that would make the project most valuable.  Ecosystem Project Ideas tend to be larger than Contribution Opportunities.

#### üèõÔ∏è Foundation Missions (RFPs)

Foundation Missions (aka RFPs) are proposals for specific initiatives that achieve an Optimism Collective **Intent** ‚Äî a directional goal that helps the Collective align and work together.  You can think of a Foundation Mission as an arrow aiming at the target (the Intent).  Just as there are many paths an arrow might take on its way to a target, there are many different Foundation Missions that might accomplish an Intent.

Unlike the tasks listed in other categories, Foundation Missions act as requests for proposals (RFPs) that teams can apply for.  A limited number of teams are selected to work on a given Foundation Mission at any given time.  Foundation Missions also typically come with attached grants for the completion of the Mission.
