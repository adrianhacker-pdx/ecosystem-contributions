# The Optimism Action Hub

## Scope of the Optimism Action Hub

All the things you can learn about or do here:

* [Fast Orientation](./#governance) to Optimism Governance
* Contributor rewards through [RetroPGF](https://app.optimism.io/retropgf)
* Contributor rewards through [grants](https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/get-a-grant/)
* Finding an open project
* [Inspiration ](https://community.optimism.io/docs/contribute/)for ideas
* How an idea becomes an actionable item
* Actionable item categories (high-level task organization)
* Actionable item tags (fine-tuned task organization)
* Tips and resources for contributor success
* Funding ecosystem improvement projects
* Support and additional resources

## Impact=Profit

Rewards and profit in the Optimism Collective come from how large an impact a contribution makes to the ecosystem.  Rewards are not upfront or a guarantee.  Rewards happen when a task or project is completed and the overall impact on the Collective can be evaluated.  More on this in the Funding and Rewards section.

This hub is where all the actionable items in the Optimism ecosystem are organized and tracked.   An actionable item refers to any work task or project that contributes to the mission and vision of the Optimism Collective.  It also refers to creative use case ideas and project proposals that have more of a research and development or proof of concept focus but may not be practical for implementation. &#x20;

Finally, support and resources for contributors of all experience levels can be found here.  Feedback and ideas on how this hub can be made better are welcome, just open an issue and describe your suggestion.

## Optimism Governance and Code of Conduct <a href="#governance" id="governance"></a>

Familiarity with the [Optimism Collective's governance structure ](https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/)and code of conduct will help ensure that contributors are successful within the ecosystem.  Key aspects of Optimism governance and code of conduct can be found using the following links:&#x20;

* [The Optimism Vision](https://www.optimism.io/vision)
* [Working Constitution of the Optimism Collective](https://gov.optimism.io/t/working-constitution-of-the-optimism-collective/55)
* [Optimism Governance Operating Manual](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/manual.md)
* [Code of Conduct](https://gov.optimism.io/t/code-of-conduct/5751)

Important, but less relevant to contributing, governance documentation exists for both the [Citizen House ](https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/citizens-house/)and the [Token House](https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/token-house/) which are the bi-cameral governance bodies of the Optimism Collective.
