## Working on a Project

### Working on Foundation Missions (RFPs)

Foundation Missions (RFPs) are the most formal type of project listed within this repository. Foundation Missions include OP token grants for completion and typically require teams to explicitly propose to work on a given task during an open proposal period. One or more teams are selected to work on the task (based on the parameters of the Mission) and OP token grants are subject to a one-year lock-up. You should refer to the exact details of the Mission you're interested in working on to get a better understanding of the working process.

### Working on Other Projects

All other projects (any that are not Foundation Missions) do not have any formal working process or proposal period. You are free to work on any of these tasks at any time. **We highly recommend making a comment within the project's corresponding GitHub issue when you've decided to start work.** This can help reduce duplicated work and can help connect you to other contributors who may be interested in working on the same task.
