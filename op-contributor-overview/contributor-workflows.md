These are example contributor workflows for each category.  The examples shown are just one method.  Your workflow as a contributor may vary based on your preferences, project complexities, and other factors.

#### ‚ú® Contribution Opportunities Example Workflow

* Fork the Ecosystem Contributor GitHub repository or synchronize your previously cloned fork of the repository.&#x20;
* Read and understand the Optimism contributor project structure.
* Search for opportunities that use the "Contribution Opportunities" tag.
* Review the task and ensure that you understand the required skills and outcomes.
* Create a comment on the issue page of a task to ask clarifying questions before starting work.
* Create a comment on the issue page of a task to state you are beginning work on the item.
* Work on the task in your forked repository and submit a pull request once you have made all necessary commits.
* Check on the pull request status and resolve any issues stated by the pull request reviewer.
* Commit your additional changes based on feedback and resubmit a pull request for review. &#x20;
* Repeat the review and editing process until your pull request is approved and merged.

This flow assumes that you have already thought of a brilliant new use case within the Optimism Ecosystem.

* Navigate to the \[Optimism Ecosystem Contributor Repository]\([https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem-contributions](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem-contributions)).
* Copy the Project Proposal Template to the clipboard.  This template can be found below or in the "Issues" tab in the issue titled.
* Open a new "Issue" and paste the completed template into the body.  Use the same brief yet descriptive title for the issue and the project template.
* If the project is appropriate for a hackathon, state that in the issue.
* Structure your project within a GitHub repository in your own personal GitHub account.  Ensure that the repository is set to "public".
* Upon project completion create another issue indicating that the project is ready to be reviewed.

#### üìù Draft Project Ideas Example Workflow

* Create a new issue for the draft project idea and give it a short yet meaningful title.
* Write the narrative of your idea as best as possible.  If there are questions or gaps in the flow, request suggestions from others to provide answers.
* List unknowns or barriers to implementation as you understand them.
* Advertise your idea in Optimism social media to gather support and traction for the project.
* The project may stay in draft form forever or may one day be implemented.  Keep your expectations low.
* If enough of the draft is actionable you can begin work in a personal GitHub repository.  Include a link to your repository in the issue you create on the contributor hub.

#### üî¥ Ecosystem Project Ideas Example Workflow

* These projects are usually much larger in scope and deliverables and therefore may be best suited for a team.
* These project ideas are supposed to be understood from start to finish and able to be implemented.
* Generate a thorough use case outlining the actors and actions they take in the system.  State their needs and what a successful outcome looks like.  Use cases can be represented in words and flow charts.
* Invite project feedback to be posted in the comment section of the issue you created.  Promote the idea on the Optimism social platforms to get support.&#x20;
* Identify the key holders and stakeholders and get permission from them to start and implement the project.
* Use a project proposal template and open an issue on the contributor hub with as much information as possible.

#### üèõÔ∏è Foundation Missions (RFPs) Best Known Methods

These projects represent core components of Optimisms mission and functionality.  These projects will have clear deliverables, expectations of a high-quality solution, and be closely watched.  Each RFP workflow will look quite different from one another.  These are small to large team sized projects and there is usually an application process to complete.  One or more groups are selected to perform work on the project.

The workflows listed above represent examples and are not absolute. Writing a rough draft of your intended workflow is good practice and sets your project up further for success.
