# Funding and Rewards

## Funding and Rewards

Your time is your most valuable asset. [The Optimism Collective believes that impact to the collective should be rewarded with profit to the individual](https://www.optimism.io/vision). The Optimism Collective ecosystem has various pathways for you to be potentially funded or rewarded for the work that you do. Here we'll take a look at the options available to you.

### Retroactive Public Goods Funding

[Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RetroPGF)](https://app.optimism.io/retropgf) is a mechanism that rewards people and projects for the positive impact they have on the Optimism Collective beyond the profit that they already receive. RetroPGF attempts to balance the equation [**impact=profit**](https://www.optimism.io/vision). If you're creating value for the Collective that isn't already being rewarded (e.g., via a sustainable business model), the Collective will do its best to fill the gap through its regular RetroPGF rounds.

RetroPGF rounds currently occur approximately once per quarter and will become more regular as time goes on. Rounds include a voting process in which a dynamic set of real people (called "badgeholders") vote on the distribution of OP tokens to nominated projects. The latest RetroPGF round, [RetroPGF#2](https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/retropgf-2/), distributed [10m OP tokens](https://optimism.mirror.xyz/Upn\_LtV2-3SviXgX\_PE\_LyA7YI00jQyoM1yf55ltvvI) to 195 nominated projects (all 195 nominated projects were rewarded in this case).

**Any project can be nominated for a RetroPGF round (including any completed project from this repository!).** Exact distribution details are determined by the set of badgeholders for a given round, the scope of the round, and the impact that each nominated project has had relative to its profit.

RetroPGF is always a fantastic default option for being rewarded for the work that you do. Unlike traditional up-front grants, RetroPGF is distributed _after_ impact has already been made and there is never a 100% likelihood that any given project will be rewarded. We've done our best in this repository to reflect tasks that are likely to be valuable to the Optimism Collective ecosystem and have specified the potential impact of each project in the "Impact" section of each task. The existence of a project within this repository does NOT guarantee that the project will be rewarded via RetroPGF.

Please feel free to liberally use the comment section of a task to ask clarifying questions that might help you make a decision of whether or not to work on a project.

### Foundation Mission (RFP) Grants

Most of the [Foundation Missions (RFPs)](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem-contributions#%EF%B8%8F-foundation-missions-rfps) within this repository include attached OP token grants that are distributed on completion of the proposed project. Foundation Missions, unlike other contribution types in this repository, typically have an application period during which teams can propose to work on a given Mission. A limited number of teams are selected for these types of Foundation Missions, each of which receives the attached grant on completion of the Mission.

Exact details about the size of the OP grant, the application process, and the number of teams that can be selected for a given Mission are all clearly defined on the GitHub issue describing that Mission.

### Optimism Collective Governance Grants

The Optimism Collective also coordinates an array of grant programs operated by Optimism Collective Governance. Governance Grants are typically up-front grants and require projects to make a detailed proposal. Governance Grants may include restrictions on the scope and usage of the grant. You should always refer to the forum page describing each grant to better understand any details or restrictions.

As of 2023-05-25, the following Governance Grant programs are currently active or will become active soon:

* [Token House Missions](https://gov.optimism.io/t/token-house-missions/5881) (begins July 8th 2023)
  * Grants for projects that support one of the Optimism Collective [Intents](https://gov.optimism.io/t/collective-intents/5874)
* [Optimism Grants Council](https://foul-porch-0eb.notion.site/Optimism-Grants-Council-090bb648d1854136b9630c608da7a8bc) (begins July 8th 2023)
  * Focused on "builders & novel use cases" and "growth experiments"
  * Generally small (sub 50k OP) grants
* Partner Fund (ongoing)
  * Reach out to the Optimism Foundation team if you feel the above mechanisms don't fit your needs
